/// Erode all chunks by amount.

/// Our equation is:
///
///   dh(p) / dt = uplift(p)âˆ’k * A(p)^m * slope(p)^n
///
///   where A(p) is the drainage area at p, m and n are constants
///   (we choose m = 0.4 and n = 1), and k is a constant.  We choose
///
///   k = 2.244 * uplift.max() / (desired_max_height)
///
///   since this tends to produce mountains of max height desired_max_height;
/// and we set   desired_max_height = 1.0 to reflect limitations of mountain
/// scale.
///
/// This algorithm does this in four steps:
///
/// 1. Sort the nodes in h by height (so the lowest node by altitude is first
///    in the list, and the highest node by altitude is last).
/// 2. Iterate through the list in *reverse.*  For each node, we compute its
///    drainage area as the sum of the drainage areas of its "children" nodes
///    (i.e. the nodes with directed edges to this node).  To do this
///    efficiently, we start with the "leaves" (the highest nodes), which
///    have no neighbors higher than them, hence no directed edges to them.
///    We add their area to themselves, and then to all neighbors that they
///    flow into (their "ancestors" in the flow graph); currently, this just
///    means the node immediately downhill of this node. As we go lower, we
///    know that all our "children" already had their areas computed, which
///    means that we can repeat the process in order to derive all the final
///    areas.
/// 3. Now, iterate through the list in *order.*  Whether we used the filling
///    method to compute a "filled" version of each depression, or used the lake
///    connection algorithm described in [1], each node is guaranteed to have
///    zero or one drainage edges out, representing the direction of water flow
///    for that node. For nodes i with zero drainage edges out (boundary nodes
///    and lake bottoms) we set the slope to 0 (so the change in altitude is
///    uplift(i))
///    For nodes with at least one drainage edge out, we take advantage of the
///    fact that we are computing new heights in order and rewrite our equation
///    as (letting j = downhill[i], A[i] be the computed area of point i,
///    p(i) be the x-y position of point i,
///    flux(i) = k * A[i]^m / ((p(i) - p(j)).magnitude()), and Î´t = 1):
///
///    h[i](t + dt) = h[i](t) + Î´t * (uplift[i] + flux(i) * h[j](t + Î´t)) / (1 +
/// flux(i) * Î´t).
///
///    Since we compute heights in ascending order by height, and j is downhill
/// from i, h[j] will    always be the *new* h[j](t + Î´t), while h[i] will still
/// not have been computed yet, so we    only need to visit each node once.
///
/// Afterwards, we also apply a hillslope diffusion process using an ADI
/// (alternating direction implicit) method:
///
/// https://github.com/fastscape-lem/fastscapelib-fortran/blob/master/src/Diffusion.f90
///
/// We also borrow the implementation for sediment transport from
///
/// https://github.com/fastscape-lem/fastscapelib-fortran/blob/master/src/StreamPowerLaw.f90
///
/// The  approximate equation for soil production function (predicting the rate
/// at which bedrock turns into soil, increasing the distance between the
/// basement and altitude) is taken from equation (11) from [2].  This (among
/// numerous other sources) also includes at least one prediction that hillslope
/// diffusion should be nonlinear, which we sort of attempt to approximate.
