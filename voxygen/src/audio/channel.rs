//! Distinct audio playback channels for music and sound effects
//!
//! Voxygen's audio system uses a limited number of channels to play multiple
//! sounds simultaneously. Each additional channel used decreases performance
//! in-game, so the amount of channels utilized should be kept to a minimum.
//!
//! When constructing a new [`AudioFrontend`](../struct.AudioFrontend.html), two
//! music channels are created internally (to achieve crossover fades) while the
//! number of sfx channels are determined by the `num_sfx_channels` value
//! defined in the client
//! [`AudioSettings`](../../settings/struct.AudioSettings.html)
//!
//! When the AudioFrontend's
//! [`emit_sfx`](../struct.AudioFrontend.html#method.emit_sfx)
//! methods is called, it attempts to retrieve an SfxChannel for playback. If
//! the channel capacity has been reached and all channels are occupied, a
//! warning is logged, and no sound is played.
