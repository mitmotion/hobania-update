//! Handles music playback and transitions
//!
//! Game music is controlled though a configuration file found in the source at
//! `/assets/voxygen/audio/soundtrack.ron`. Each track enabled in game has a
//! configuration corresponding to the
//! [`SoundtrackItem`](struct.SoundtrackItem.html) format, as well as the
//! corresponding `.ogg` file in the `/assets/voxygen/audio/soundtrack/`
//! directory.
//!
//! If there are errors while reading or deserialising the configuration file, a
//! warning is logged and music will be disabled.
//!
//! ## Adding new music
//!
//! To add a new item, append the details to the audio configuration file, and
//! add the audio file (in `.ogg` format) to the assets directory.
//!
//! The `length` should be provided in seconds. This allows us to know when to
//! transition to another track, without having to spend time determining track
//! length programmatically.
//!
//! An example of a new night time track:
//! ```text
//! (
//!     title: "Sleepy Song",
//!     path: "voxygen.audio.soundtrack.sleepy",
//!     length: 400.0,
//!     timing: Some(Night),
//!     biomes: [
//!         (Forest, 1),
//!         (Grassland, 2),
//!     ],
//!     site: None,
//!     activity: Explore,
//!     artist: "Elvis",
//! ),
//! ```
//!
//! Before sending an MR for your new track item:
//! - Be conscious of the file size for your new track. Assets contribute to
//!   download sizes
//! - Ensure that the track is mastered to a volume proportionate to other music
//!   tracks
//! - If you are not the author of the track, ensure that the song's licensing
//!   permits usage of the track for non-commercial use
