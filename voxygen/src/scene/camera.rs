/// that you pass in *1/n* and *1/f*, not n and f like you normally would for a
/// perspective projection; this is done to enable uniform handling of both
/// finite and infinite far planes.
///
/// The only requirements on n and f are: 1/n ≠ 1/f, and 0 ≤ 1/n * 1/f.
///
/// This ensures that the near and far plane are not identical (or else your
/// projection would not cover any distance), and that they have the same sign
/// (or else we cannot rely on clipping to properly fix your scene).  This also
/// ensures that at least one of 1/n and 1/f is not 0, and by construction it
/// guarantees that neither n nor f are 0; these are required in order to make
/// sense of the definition of near and far planes, and avoid collapsing all
/// depths to a single point.
///
/// For "typical" projections (matching perspective_lh_no), you would satisfy
/// the stronger requirements.  We give the typical conditions for each bullet
/// point, and then explain the consequences of not satisfying these conditions:
///
/// * 1/n < 1/f (0 to 1 depth planes, meaning n = near and f = far; if f < n,
///   depth planes go from 1 to 0, meaning f = near and n = far, aka "reverse
///   depth").
///
///     This is by far the most
///     likely thing to want to change; inverted depth coordinates have *far*
/// better accuracy for     DirectX / Metal / WGPU-like APIs, when using
/// floating point depth, while not being *worse*     than the alternative
/// (OpenGL-like depth, or when using fixed-point / integer depth).  For
///     maximum benefit, make sure you are using Depth32F, as on most platforms
/// this is the only     depth buffer size where floating point can be used.
///
///     It is a bit unintuitive to prove this, but it turns out that when using
/// 1 to 0 depth planes,     the point where the depth buffer has its worst
/// precision is not at the far plane (as with 0     to 1 depth planes) nor at
/// the near plane, as you might expect, but exactly at far/2 (the
///     near plane setting does not affect the point of minimum accuracy at
/// all!).  However, don't     let this fool you into believing the point of
/// worst precision has simply been moved     around--for *any* fixed Δz that is
/// the minimum amount of depth precision you want over the     whole range, and
/// any near plane, you can set the far plane farther (generally much much
///     farther!) with reversed clip space than you can with standard clip space
/// while still     getting at least that much depth precision in the worst
/// case.  Nor is this a small     worst-case; for many desirable near and far
/// plane combinations, more than half the visible     space will have
/// completely unusable precision under 0 to 1 depth, while having much better
///     than needed precision under 1 to 0 depth.
///
///     To compute the exact (at least "roughly exact") worst-case accuracy for
/// floating     point depth and a given precision target Δz, for reverse clip
/// planes (this can be computed     for the non-reversed case too, but it's
/// painful and the values are horrible, so don't     bother), we compute
/// (assuming a finite far plane--see below for details on the infinite
///     case) the change in the integer representation of the mantissa at z=n/2:
///
///     ```ignore
///     e = floor(ln(near/(far - near))/ln(2))
///     db/dz = 2^(2-e) / ((1 / far - 1 / near) * (far)^2)
///     ```
///
///     Then the maximum precision you can safely use to get a change in the
/// integer representation     of the mantissa (assuming 32-bit floating points)
/// is around:
///
///     ```ignore
///     abs(2^(-23) / (db/dz)).
///     ```
///
///     In particular, if your worst-case target accuracy over the depth range
/// is Δz, you should     be okay if:
///
///     ```ignore
///     abs(Δz * (db/dz)) * 2^(23) ≥ 1.
///     ```
///
///     This only accounts for precision of the final floating-point value, so
/// it's     possible that artifacts may be introduced elsewhere during the
/// computation that reduce     precision further; the most famous example of
/// this is that OpenGL wipes out most of the     precision gains by going from
/// [-1,1] to [0,1] by letting
///
///     ```ignore
///     clip space depth = depth * 0.5 + 0.5
///     ```
///
///     which results in huge precision errors by removing nearly all the
/// floating point values     with the most precision (those close to 0).
/// Fortunately, most such artifacts are absent     under the wgpu/DirectX/Metal
/// depth clip space model, so with any luck remaining depth     errors due to
/// the perspective warp itself should be minimal.
///
/// * 0 ≠ 1/far (finite far plane).  When this is false, the far plane is at
///   infinity; this removes the restriction of having a far plane at all, often
///   with minimal reduction in accuracy for most values in the scene.  In fact,
///   in almost all cases with non-reversed depth planes, it *improves* accuracy
///   over the finite case for the vast majority of the range; however, you
///   should be using reversed depth planes, and if you are then there is a
///   quite natural accuracy vs. distance tradeoff in the infinite case.
///
///     When using an infinite far plane, the worst-case accuracy is *always* at
/// infinity, and gets     progressively worse as you get farther away from the
/// near plane.  However, there is a     second advantage that may not be
/// immediately apparent: the perspective warp becomes much     simpler,
/// potentially removing artifacts!  Specifically, in the 0 to 1 depth plane
/// case, the     assigned depth value (after perspective division) becomes:
///
///     ```ignore
///     depth = 1 - near/z
///     ```
///
///     while in the 1 to 0 depth plane case (which you should be using), the
/// equation is even     simpler:
///
///     ```ignore
///     depth = near/z
///     ```
///
///     In the 1 to 0 case, in particular, you can see that the depth value is
/// *linear in z in     log space.*  This lets us compute, for any given target
/// precision, a *very* simple     worst-case upper bound on the maximum
/// absolute z value for which that precision can     be achieved (the upper
/// bound is tight in some cases, but in others may be conservative):
///
///     ```ignore
///     db/dz ≥ 1/z
///     ```
///
///     Plugging that into our old formula, we find that we attain the required
/// precision at least     in the range (again, this is for the 1 to 0 infinite
/// case only!):
///
///     ```ignore
///     abs(z) ≤ Δz * 2^23
///     ```
///
///     One thing you may notice is that this worst-case bound *does not depend
/// on the near plane.*     This means that (within reason) you can put the near
/// plane as close as you like and still     attain this bound.  Of course, the
/// bound is not completely tight, but it should not be off     by more than a
/// factor of 2 or so (informally proven, not made rigorous yet), so for most
///     practical purposes you can set the near plane as low as you like in this
/// case.
///
/// * 0 < 1/near (positive near plane--best used when moving *to* left-handed
///   spaces, as we normally do in OpenGL and DirectX).  A use case for *not*
///   doing this is that it allows moving *from* a left-handed space *to* a
///   right-handed space in WGPU / DirectX / Metal coordinates; this means that
///   if matrices were already set up for OpenGL using functions like look_at_rh
///   that assume right-handed coordinates, we can simply switch these to
///   look_at_lh and use a right-handed perspective projection with a negative
///   near plane, to get correct rendering behavior.  Details are out of scope
///   for this comment.
///
/// Note that there is one final, very important thing that affects possible
/// precision--the actual underlying precision of the floating point format at a
/// particular value!  As your z values go up, their precision will shrink, so
/// if at all possible try to shrink your z values down to the lowest range in
/// which they can be.  Unfortunately, this cannot be part of the perspective
/// projection itself, because by the time z gets to the projection it is
/// usually too late for values to still be integers (or coarse-grained powers
/// of 2).  Instead, try to scale down x, y, and z as soon as possible before
/// submitting them to the GPU, ideally by as large as possible of a power of 2
/// that works for your use case.  Not only will this improve depth precision
/// and recall, it will also help address other artifacts caused by values far
/// from z (such as improperly rounded rotations, or improper line equations due
/// to greedy meshing).
///
/// TODO: Consider passing fractions rather than 1/n and 1/f directly, even
/// though the logic for why it should be okay to pass them directly is probably
/// sound (they are both valid z values in the range, so gl_FragCoord.w will be
/// assigned to this, meaning if they are imprecise enough then the whole
/// calculation will be similarly imprecise).
///
/// TODO: Since it's a bit confusing that n and f are not always near and far,
/// and a negative near plane can (probably) be emulated with simple actions on
/// the perspective matrix, consider removing this functionality and replacing
/// our assertion with a single condition: `(1/far) * (1/near) < (1/near)²`.
