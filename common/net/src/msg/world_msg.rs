    /// regular structure (e.g. no holes) to compress all information needed
    /// to decide when to cast a sharp shadow into a single nagle, the "horizon
    /// angle."  This is the smallest angle with the ground at which light can
    /// pass through any occluders to reach the chunk, in some chosen
    /// horizontal direction.  This would not be sufficient for a more
    /// complicated 3D structure, but it works for height maps since:
    ///
    /// 1. they have no gaps, so as soon as light can shine through it will
    /// always be able to do    so, and
    /// 2. we only care about lighting from the top, and only from the east and
    /// west    (since at a large scale like this we mostly just want to
    /// handle variable sunlight;    moonlight would present more challenges
    /// but we currently have no plans to try to cast    accurate shadows in
    /// moonlight).
    ///
    /// Our chosen format is two pairs of vectors,
    /// with the first pair representing west-facing light (casting shadows on
    /// the left side)  and the second representing east-facing light
    /// (casting shadows on the east side).
    ///
    /// The pair of vectors consists of (with each vector in the usual chunk
    /// order):
    ///
    /// * Horizon angle pointing east (1 byte, scaled so 1 unit = 255° / 360).
    ///   We might consider switching to tangent if that represents the
    ///   information we care about better.
    /// * Approximate (floor) height of maximal occluder. We currently use this
    ///   to try to deliver some approximation of soft shadows, which isn't that
    ///   big a deal on the world map but is probably needed in order to ensure
    ///   smooth transitions between chunks in LoD view.  Additionally, when we
    ///   start using the shadow information to do local lighting on the world
    ///   map, we'll want a quick way to test where we can go out of shadow at
    ///   arbitrary heights (since the player and other entities cajn find
    ///   themselves far from the ground at times).  While this is only an
    ///   approximation to a proper distance map, hopefully it will give us
    ///   something  that feels reasonable enough for Veloren's style.
    ///
    /// NOTE: On compression.
    ///
    /// Horizon mapping has a lot of advantages for height maps (simple, easy to
    /// understand, doesn't require any fancy math or approximation beyond
    /// precision loss), though it loses a few of them by having to store
    /// distance to occluder as well.  However, just storing tons
    /// and tons of regular shadow maps (153 for a full day cycle, stored at
    /// irregular intervals) combined with clever explicit compression and
    /// avoiding recording sharp local shadows (preferring retracing for
    /// these), yielded a compression rate of under 3 bits per column! Since
    /// we likely want to avoid per-column shadows for worlds of the sizes we
    /// want, we'd still need to store *some* extra information to create
    /// soft shadows, but it would still be nice to try to drive down our
    /// size as much as possible given how compressible shadows of height
    /// maps seem to be in practice.  Therefore, we try to take advantage of the
    /// way existing compression algorithms tend to work to see if we can
    /// achieve significant gains without doing a lot of custom work.
    ///
    /// Specifically, since our rays are cast east/west, we expect that for each
    /// row, the horizon angles in each direction should be sequences of
    /// monotonically increasing values (as chunks approach a tall
    /// occluder), followed by sequences of no shadow, repeated
    /// until the end of the map.  Monotonic sequences and same-byte sequences
    /// are usually easy to compress and existing algorithms are more likely
    /// to be able to deal with them than jumbled data.  If we were to keep
    /// both directions in the same vector, off-the-shelf compression would
    /// probably be less effective.
    ///
    /// For related reasons, rather than storing distances as in a standard
    /// distance map (which would lead to monotonically *decreasing* values
    /// as we approached the occluder from a given direction), we store the
    /// estimated *occluder height.*  The idea here is that we replace the
    /// monotonic sequences with constant sequences, which are extremely
    /// straightforward to compress and mostly handled automatically by anything
    /// that does run-length encoding (i.e. most off-the-shelf compression
    /// algorithms).
    ///
    /// We still need to benchmark this properly, as there's no guarantee our
    /// current compression algorithms will actually work well on this data
    /// in practice.  It's possible that some other permutation (e.g. more
    /// bits reserved for "distance to occluder" in exchange for an even
    /// more predictible sequence) would end up compressing better than storing
    /// angles, or that we don't need as much precision as we currently have
    /// (256 possible angles).
