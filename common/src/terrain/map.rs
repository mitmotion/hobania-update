/// Base two logarithm of the maximum size of the precomputed world, in meters,
/// along the x (E/W) and y (N/S) dimensions.
///
/// NOTE: Each dimension is guaranteed to be a power of 2, so the logarithm is
/// exact. This is so that it is possible (at least in theory) for compiler or
/// runtime optimizations exploiting this are possible.  For example, division
/// by the chunk size can turn into a bit shift.
///
/// NOTE: As an invariant, this value is at least [TERRAIN_CHUNK_BLOCKS_LG].
///
/// NOTE: As an invariant, `(1 << [MAX_WORLD_BLOCKS_LG])` fits in an i32.
///
/// TODO: Add static assertions for the above invariants.
///
/// Currently, we define the maximum to be 19 (corresponding to 2^19 m) for both
/// directions. This value was derived by backwards reasoning from the following
/// conservative estimate of the maximum landmass area (using an approximation
/// of 1024 blocks / km instead of 1000 blocks / km, which will result in an
/// estimate that is strictly lower than the real landmass):
///
/// Max area (km²)
///     ≌ (2^19 blocks * 1 km / 1024 blocks)^2
///     = 2^((19 - 10) * 2) km²
///     = 2^18 km²
///     = 262,144 km²
///
/// which is roughly the same area as the entire United Kingdom, and twice the
/// horizontal extent of Dwarf Fortress's largest map.  Besides the comparison
/// to other games without infinite or near-infinite maps (like Dwarf Fortress),
/// there are other reasons to choose this as a good maximum size:
///
/// * It is large enough to include geological features of fairly realistic
///   scale.  It may be hard to do justice to truly enormous features like the
///   Amazon River, and natural temperature variation not related to altitude
///   would probably not produce climate extremes on an Earth-like planet, but
///   it can comfortably fit enormous river basins, Everest-scale mountains,
///   large islands and inland lakes, vast forests and deserts, and so on.
///
/// * It is large enough that making it from one side of the map to another will
///   take a *very* long time.  We show this with two examples.  In each
///   example, travel is either purely horizontal or purely vertical (to
///   minimize distance traveled) across the whole map, and we assume there are
///   no obstacles or slopes.
///
///   In example 1, a human is walking at the (real-time) speed of the fastest
/// marathon runners   (around 6 blocks / real-time s).  We assume the human can
/// maintain this pace indefinitely   without stopping.  Then crossing the map
/// will take about:
///
///   2^19 blocks * 1 real-time s / 6 blocks * 1 real-time min / 60 real-time s
/// * 1 real-time hr / 60 real-time min * 1 real-time days / 24 hr = 2^19 / 6 /
///   60 / 60 / 24 real-time days ≌ 1 real-time day.
///
///   That's right--it will take a full day of *real* time to cross the map at
/// an apparent speed of   6 m / s.  Moreover, since in-game time passes at a
/// rate of 1 in-game min / 1 in-game s, this   would also take *60 days* of
/// in-game time.
///
///   Still though, this is the rate of an ordinary human.  And besides that, if
/// we instead had a   marathon runner traveling at 6 m / in-game s, it would
/// take just 1 day of in-game time for   the runner to cross the map, or a mere
/// 0.4 hr of real time.   To show that this rate of travel is unrealistic (and
/// perhaps make an eventual argument for   a slower real-time to in-game time
/// conversion rate), our second example will consist of a   high-speed train
/// running at 300 km / real-time h (the fastest real-world high speed train
///   averages under 270 k m / h, with 300 km / h as the designed top speed).
/// For a train   traveling at this apparent speed (in real time), crossing the
/// map would take:
///
///   2^19 blocks * 1 km / 1000 blocks * 1 real-time hr / 300 km
///   = 2^19 / 1000 / 300 real-time hr
///   ≌ 1.75 real-time hr
///
///   = 2^19 / 1000 / 300 real-time hr * 60 in-game hr / real-time hr
///     * 1 in-game days / 24 in-game hr
///   = 2^19 / 1000 / 300 * 60 / 24 in-game days
///   ≌ 4.37 in-game days
///
///   In other words, something faster in real-time than any existing high-speed
/// train would be   over 4 times slower (in real-time) than our hypothetical
/// top marathon runner running at 6 m /   s in in-game speed.  This suggests
/// that the gap between in-game time and real-time is   probably much too large
/// for most purposes; however, what it definitely shows is that even
///   extremely fast in-game transport across the world will not trivialize its
/// size.
///
///   It follows that cities or towns of realistic scale, player housing,
/// fields, and so on, will   all fit comfortably on a map of this size, while
/// at the same time still being reachable by   non-warping, in-game mechanisms
/// (such as high-speed transit).  It also provides plenty of   room for mounts
/// of varying speeds, which can help ensure that players don't feel cramped or
///   deliberately slowed down by their own speed.
///
/// * It is small enough that it is (barely) plausible that we could still
///   generate maps for a world of this size using detailed and realistic
///   erosion algorithms.  At 1/4 of this map size along each dimension,
///   generation currently takes around 5 hours on a good computer, and one
///   could imagine (since the bottleneck step appears to be roughly O(n)) that
///   with a smart implementation generation times of under a week could be
///   achievable.
///
/// * The map extends further than the resolution of human eyesight under
///   Earthlike conditions, even from tall mountains across clear landscapes.
///   According to one calculation, even from Mt. Everest in the absence of
///   cloud cover, you could only see for about 339 km before the Earth's
///   horizon prevented you from seeing further, and other sources suggest that
///   in practice the limit is closer to 160 km under realistic conditions. This
///   implies that making the map much larger in a realistic way would require
///   incorporating curvature, and also implies that any features that cannot
///   fit on the map would not (under realistic atmospheric conditions) be fully
///   visible from any point on Earth.  Therefore, even if we cannot represent
///   features larger than this accurately, nothing should be amiss from a
///   visual perspective, so this should not significantly impact the player
///   experience.
